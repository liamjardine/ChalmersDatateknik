At each jump the decision maker receives a reward, and the objective is to find a sequence of decisions (or an optimal policy) that maximizes the accumulated rewards.\n",

    "two parts. First, how do we learn about the world? This involves both the\n",
    "problem of modeling our initial uncertainty about the world, and that of drawing conclusions from evidence and our initial belief. Secondly, given what we\n",
    "currently know about the world, how should we decide what to do, taking into\n",
    "account future events and observations that may change our conclusions?\n",
    "Typically, this will involve creating long-term plans covering possible future\n",
    "eventualities. That is, when planning under uncertainty, we also need to take\n",
    "into account what possible future knowledge could be generated when implementing our plans. Intuitively, executing plans which involve trying out new\n",
    "things should give more information, but it is hard to tell whether this information will be beneficial. The choice between doing something which is already\n",

    "### Markov Decision Processes\n",
    "Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) provide a mathematical framework for modeling sequential decision making under uncertainty. An *agent* moves between *states* in a *state space* choosing *actions* that affects the transition probabilities between states, and the subsequent *rewards* recieved after a jump. This is then repeated a finite or infinite number of epochs. The objective, or the *solution* of the MDP, is to optimize the accumulated rewards of the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, an MDP consists of five parts: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Decision epochs: $t={1,2,...,T}$, where $T\\leq \\infty$\n",
    "* State space: $S=\\{s_1,s_2,...,s_N\\}$ of the underlying environment\n",
    "* Action space $A=\\{a_1,a_2,...,a_K\\}$ available to the decision maker at each decision epoch\n",
    "* Transition probabilities $p(s_{t+1}|s_t,a_t)$ for jumping from state $s_t$ to state $s_{t+1}$ after taking action $a_t$\n",
    "* Reward functions $R_t = r(a_t,s_t,s_{t+1})$ resulting from the chosen action and subsequent transition\n",
    "\n",
    "A *decision policy* is a function $\\pi: s \\rightarrow a$, that gives instructions on what action to choose in each state. A policy can either be *deterministic*, meaning that the action is given for each state, or *randomized* meaning that there is a probability distribution over the set of possible actions for each state. Given a specific policy $\\pi$ we can then compute the the *expected total reward* when starting in a given state $s_1 \\in S$, which is also known as the *value* for that state, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$V^\\pi (s_1) = E\\left[ \\sum_{t=1}^{T} r(s_t,a_t,s_{t+1}) {\\Large |} s_1\\right] = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} r(s_t,a_t,s_{t+1}) p(s_{t+1} | a_t,s_t)$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $a_t = \\pi(s_t)$. To ensure convergence and to control how much credit to give to future rewards, it is common to introduce a *discount factor* $\\gamma \\in [0,1]$. For instance, if we think all future rewards should count equally, we would use $\\gamma = 1$, while if we value near-future rewards higher than more distant rewards, we would use $\\gamma < 1$. The expected total *discounted* reward then becomes\n",

    "Now, to find the *optimal* policy we want to find the policy $\\pi^*$ that gives the highest total reward $V^*(s)$ for all $s\\in S$. That is, we want to find the policy where\n",

    "A real world example would be an inventory control system. The states could be the amount of items we have in stock, and the actions would be the amount of items to order at the end of each month. The discrete time would be each month and the reward would be the profit. \n"

    "For larger problems we need to utilize algorithms to determine the optimal policy $\\pi^*$. *Value iteration* is one such algorithm that iteratively computes the value for each state. Recall that for a policy to be optimal, it must satisfy the Bellman equation above, meaning that plugging in a given candidate $V^*$ in the right-hand side (RHS) of the Bellman equation should result in the same $V^*$ on the left-hand side (LHS). This property will form the basis of our algorithm. Essentially, it can be shown that repeated application of the RHS to any intial value function $V^0(s)$ will eventually lead to the value $V$ which statifies the Bellman equation. Hence repeated application of the Bellman equation will also lead to the optimal value function. We can then extract the optimal policy by simply noting what actions that satisfy the equation.    "

    "## Reinforcement Learning (RL)\n",
    "Until now, we understood that knowing the MDP, specifically $p(s'|a,s)$ and $r(s,a,s')$ allows us to efficiently find the optimal policy using the value iteration algorithm. Reinforcement learning (RL) or decision making under uncertainity, however, arises from the question of making optimal decisions without knowing the true world model (the MDP in this case).\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have defined the value function for a policy through $V^\\pi$. Let's now define the *action-value function*\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q^\\pi(s,a) = \\sum_{s'} p(s'|a,s) [r(s,a,s') + \\gamma V^\\pi(s')]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The value function and the action-value function are directly related through\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V^\\pi (s) = \\max_a Q^\\pi (s,a)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "i.e, the value of taking action $a$ in state $s$ and then following the policy $\\pi$ onwards. Similarly to the value function, the optimal $Q$-value equation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q^*(s,a) = \\sum_{s'} p(s'|a,s) [r(s,a,s') + \\gamma V^*(s')]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the relationship between $Q^*(s,a)$ and $V^*(s)$ is simply\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V^*(s) = \\max_{a\\in A} Q^*(s,a).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q-learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Q-learning is a RL-method where the agent learns about its unknown environment (i.e. the MDP is unknown) through exploration. In each time step *t* the agent chooses an action *a* based on the current state *s*, observes the reward *r* and the next state *s'*, and repeats the process in the new state. Q-learning is then a method that allows the agent to act optimally. Here we will focus on the simplest form of Q-learning algorithms, which can be applied when all states are known to the agent, and the state and action spaces are reasonably small. This simple algorithm uses a table of Q-values for each $(s,a)$ pair, which is then updated in each time step using the update rule in step $k+1$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q_{k+1}(s,a) = Q_k(s,a) + \\alpha \\left( r(s,a) + \\gamma \\max \\{Q_k(s',a')\\} - Q_k(s,a) \\right) $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\gamma$ is the discount factor as before, and $\\alpha$ is a pre-set learning rate. It can be shown that this algorithm converges to the optimal policy of the underlying MDP for certain values of $\\alpha$ as long as there  is sufficient exploration. For our case, we set a constant $\\alpha=0.1$.\n",

    "## OpenAI Gym\n",
    "\n",
    "We shall use already available simulators for different environments (worlds) using the popular [OpenAI Gym library](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/). It just implements different types of simulators including ATARI games. Although here we will only focus on simple ones, such as the **Chain enviroment** illustrated below.\n",
    "![alt text](https://chalmersuniversity.box.com/shared/static/6tthbzhpofq9gzlowhr3w8if0xvyxb2b.jpg)\n",
    "The figure corresponds to an MDP with 5 states $S = \\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$ and two possible actions $A=\\{a,b\\}$ in each state. The arrows indicate the resulting transitions for each state-action pair, and the numbers correspond to the rewards for each transition.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "You are to first familiarize with the framework of [the OpenAI environments](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/), and then implement the Q-learning algorithm for the <code>NChain-v0</code> enviroment depicted above, using default parameters and a learning rate of $\\gamma=0.95$. Report the final $Q^*$ table after convergence of the algorithm. For an example on how to do this, you can refer to the Q-learning of the **Frozen lake environment** (<code>q_learning_frozen_lake.ipynb</code>), uploaded on Canvas. Hint: start with a small learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the NChain environment is not available among the standard environments, you need to load the <code>gym_toytext</code> package, in addition to the standard gym:\n",
