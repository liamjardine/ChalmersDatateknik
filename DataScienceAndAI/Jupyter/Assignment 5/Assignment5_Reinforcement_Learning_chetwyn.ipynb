At each jump the decision maker receives a reward, and the objective is to find a sequence of decisions (or an optimal policy) that maximizes the accumulated rewards.\n",

    "Typically, this will involve creating long-term plans covering possible future\n",

    "### Markov Decision Processes\n",
    "Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) provide a mathematical framework for modeling sequential decision making under uncertainty. An *agent* moves between *states* in a *state space* choosing *actions* that affects the transition probabilities between states, and the subsequent *rewards* recieved after a jump. This is then repeated a finite or infinite number of epochs. The objective, or the *solution* of the MDP, is to optimize the accumulated rewards of the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, an MDP consists of five parts: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Decision epochs: $t={1,2,...,T}$, where $T\\leq \\infty$\n",
    "* State space: $S=\\{s_1,s_2,...,s_N\\}$ of the underlying environment\n",
    "* Action space $A=\\{a_1,a_2,...,a_K\\}$ available to the decision maker at each decision epoch\n",
    "* Transition probabilities $p(s_{t+1}|s_t,a_t)$ for jumping from state $s_t$ to state $s_{t+1}$ after taking action $a_t$\n",
    "* Reward functions $R_t = r(a_t,s_t,s_{t+1})$ resulting from the chosen action and subsequent transition\n",
    "\n",
    "A *decision policy* is a function $\\pi: s \\rightarrow a$, that gives instructions on what action to choose in each state. A policy can either be *deterministic*, meaning that the action is given for each state, or *randomized* meaning that there is a probability distribution over the set of possible actions for each state. Given a specific policy $\\pi$ we can then compute the the *expected total reward* when starting in a given state $s_1 \\in S$, which is also known as the *value* for that state, \n",

    "\n",
    "where $a_t = \\pi(s_t)$. To ensure convergence and to control how much credit to give to future rewards, it is common to introduce a *discount factor* $\\gamma \\in [0,1]$. For instance, if we think all future rewards should count equally, we would use $\\gamma = 1$, while if we value near-future rewards higher than more distant rewards, we would use $\\gamma < 1$.

Recall that for a policy to be optimal, it must satisfy the Bellman equation above, meaning that plugging in a given candidate $V^*$ in the right-hand side (RHS) of the Bellman equation should result in the same $V^*$ on the left-hand side (LHS). This property will form the basis of our algorithm. Essentially, it can be shown that repeated application of the RHS to any intial value function $V^0(s)$ will eventually lead to the value $V$ which statifies the Bellman equation. Hence repeated application of the Bellman equation will also lead to the optimal value function. We can then extract the optimal policy by simply noting what actions that satisfy the equation.    "

    "## Q-learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Q-learning is a RL-method where the agent learns about its unknown environment (i.e. the MDP is unknown) through exploration. In each time step *t* the agent chooses an action *a* based on the current state *s*, observes the reward *r* and the next state *s'*, and repeats the process in the new state. Q-learning is then a method that allows the agent to act optimally. Here we will focus on the simplest form of Q-learning algorithms, which can be applied when all states are known to the agent, and the state and action spaces are reasonably small. This simple algorithm uses a table of Q-values for each $(s,a)$ pair, which is then updated in each time step using the update rule in step $k+1$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q_{k+1}(s,a) = Q_k(s,a) + \\alpha \\left( r(s,a) + \\gamma \\max \\{Q_k(s',a')\\} - Q_k(s,a) \\right) $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\gamma$ is the discount factor as before, and $\\alpha$ is a pre-set learning rate. It can be shown that this algorithm converges to the optimal policy of the underlying MDP for certain values of $\\alpha$ as long as there  is sufficient exploration. For our case, we set a constant $\\alpha=0.1$.\n",

    "The figure corresponds to an MDP with 5 states $S = \\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$ and two possible actions $A=\\{a,b\\}$ in each state. The arrows indicate the resulting transitions for each state-action pair, and the numbers correspond to the rewards for each transition.\n",

Report the final $Q^*$ table after convergence of the algorithm.

These three trees will be trained separately and combined together to form the random forest. When is it time to make a prediction, the input will be fed into all 3 trees individually and their prediction results will be consolidated and a count of each result will be tallied, and the majority vote will be the final output."
