for (I=0; I<8; I++)
	for (J=0; J<8000; J++)
		A[I][J]=B[I][0]+A[J][I];

1. How many 32-bit integers can be stored in a 16-byte cache block?

Answer: 1 Byte = 8 bits -> 16*8/32 = 4
In a 16-byte cache block 4 such 4-byte elements could be stored.

2. References to which variables exhibit temporal locality?

Answer: Temporal locality refers to the reuse of specific data and/or
resources within a relatively small time duration.
At each iteration I and J are needed again and again
so those variables exhibit temporal locality.

3. References to which variables exhibit spatial locality?

Answer: Spatial locality (also termed data locality) refers to the use
of data elements within relatively close storage locations.
If we need one data items neighbouring item in the future this will
knowned as spatial locality. So A exhibits spatial locality.

4. How many 16-byte cache blocks are needed to store all 32-bit matrix
elements being referenced?

for I=1:8
	for J=1:8000
		A(I,J)=B(I,0)+A(J,I);
	end
end

Answer: Word is 4 bytes or 32 bits.
A(I,J)+B(I,0) -> 8*8000(words)+8(words)/4 (words per block) = 16002

5. References to which variables exhibit temporal locality?

Answer: I and J.

6. References to which variables exhibit spatial locality?

Answer: A.

Streaming workload that accesses a 512 KiB working set sequentially with the following address stream:
0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, ...

1. Assume a 64 KiB direct-mapped cache with a 32-byte block.
What is the miss rate for the address stream above?
How is this rate sensitive to the size of the cache or the working set?
How would you categorize the misses this workload is experiencing, based in the 3C model?

Answer: One block will contain 32 consecutive elements. For example, from 0-31. As the access pattern is 
0,2,4 ...so on there will be 16 accesses to the same block where the first access is always a miss. 
So, the miss rate would be 1/16.

Miss rate is not sensitive to size of the cache or the size of working set. But it is sensitive to the 
access pattern and block size.

2. Re-compute the miss rate when the cache block size is 16, 64 and 128 bytes.
What kind of locality is the workload exploiting?

Answer: Cache Size 16 bytes -
One block will contain 16 consecutive elements. For example, from 0-15. As the access pattern is 0,2,4,...
so on there will be 8 accesses to the same block where the first access is always a miss. Miss rate = 1/8

Cache Size 64 bytes:
Miss rate = 1/32

Cache Size 128 bytes
Miss rate = 1/64

Locality Exploited:
Temporal Locality. We bring a cache block with neighbouring items 
into the cache which we will need later.
