1. Prestandaberäkningar


A program executing in an embedded system reads each time it 
runs 1000 measurements from a temperature sensor. Based on 
these values a number of system parameters are calculated and stored in memory. 
 To read a sensor value the program initiates the sensor and then 
waits for a reply when the value is available. The system is based on 
a MIPS-architecture that runs at 100 MHz and has the following 
characteristics: 
q Number of executed instructions: 2 · 109
q CPI (excluding effect of data references): 1,3 
q Number of data references: 20% of all instructions 
q Hit-ratio for data references in the cache: 90% 
q Miss penalty for data cache misses: 10 cycles 
q Average completion time for reading one sensor value: 10 ms
 (a) How long time does each run of the program take ? (



T_tot= T_CPU + T_I/O
T_I/O = 1000x 10ms = 10s
T_CPU = IC * CPI * T_c
CPI (Antal klockcykler)= 1.3 + 0.2 * 0.1 * 10 = 1.5
